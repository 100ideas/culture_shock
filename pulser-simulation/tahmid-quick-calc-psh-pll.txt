Re: Push-Pull center tap converter transformer design

    Let's take your requirements as an example. You're using 2 transformers for 600W. So, each transformer should handle 300W.

    So, your voltage conversion requirement is 12VDC to 250VDC.

    You stated the minimum voltage as 9V. So, you'd still need 250VDC at that input voltage. Let's take maximum duty cycle as 95%. So, at 9VDC input, duty cycle will be maximum. Average voltage to transformer will be 9V * 0.95 = 8.55V. Thus voltage ratio is (250V/8.55V) = 29.24. Let's leave some headroom to allow for losses and voltage drops and some headroom for feedback. So, let's take a voltage ratio of (270V/8.55V) = 31.6.

    Formula for calculating primary turns is:

    Npri = (Vinnom * 10^8) / (4 * f * Bmax * Ac)

    Ac (or sometimes called Ae) is in cm^2, Bmax is in Gauss, f is in Hertz, Vinnom is in Volts.

    Get Ac and Bmax from transformer datasheet.

    For ETD49, from the datasheet I have, I get Ac = 2.36
    I'll take Bmax to be 1800. Most cores should be okay with that. Make sure though.
    Vinnom = 12V
    f = 55000

    So, I get Npri = 1 turn (rounded off)
    Check Bmax.
    Bmax (with Npri = 1) comes out to 2311. If that's too high, increase Npri to 2. So, Bmax comes out to 1156. That should be okay.

    Nsec = (Turns Ratio) * Npri
    Turns Ratio = Voltage Ratio = 31.6
    With Npri = 1, Nsec = 32 (rounded off).
    With Npri = 2, Nsec = 63 (rounded off).

    Now, wind with a sufficient number of thin wires in parallel to minimize wire resistance and skin effect. Or use Litz wire.

    There you have it.

    Hope this helps.
    Tahmid.
