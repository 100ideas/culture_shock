The .gitignore file says to skip git tracking of .jpgs (photos) and pdfs (datasheets),
so any of them to distribute need to be saved outside the git repo as a zip file 
that unzips into the git repo dirs.

The git repo dirs that could be there to receive unzipping are:

culture_shock/photos_protos_tests_simuls
culture_shock/pulser-simul-cultshock
fab 			# contains RS274-X gerber output (generated from .lht file and the makefile

git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
git config --global user.email
your_email@example.com
